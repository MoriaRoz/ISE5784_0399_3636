# 3D Image Rendering Platform

This Java-based platform was developed as part of an Introduction to Software Engineering course at the *Jerusalem College of Technology* (May 2024 – July 2024). It enables users to generate 3D images by modeling scenes with geometric primitives, simulating lighting, and applying color and reflection effects.

## Features

- *3D Scene Rendering*  
  Create complex 3D scenes with custom objects using vector-based geometry.

- *Camera Simulation*  
  Configure various camera positions and angles to render scenes from multiple perspectives.

- *Lighting System*  
  Supports multiple light sources, including directional, point, and spot lights with realistic shading and shadow simulation.

- *Color and Material Control*  
  Customize object colors, light intensity, and surface materials for accurate visual representation.

- *Reflections & Transparency*  
  Simulate reflective surfaces and transparent materials to enhance scene realism.

## Technologies Used

- *Java* – Core programming language used throughout the project  
- *Vector Mathematics* – For object positioning, scene layout, and direction calculations  
- *Object-Oriented Design* – Ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability  
- *Color Processing* – For accurate representation of surface and lighting effects
